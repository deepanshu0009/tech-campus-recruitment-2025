1. Solution that i thought about:
   a. Linear search
   b.binary search with timestamp
   c. indexing


2. final solution: i select Binary search solution with timestamp
     i selected this solution because first data is in sorted order so going with binary search will provide high efficency
    and also log files are sorted by date so it will also reduce space storage as no extra space is used.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tech-campus-recruitment-2025.git
